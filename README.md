### Summary

This document sketches out a potential cognitive architecture for an AI system that uses a single, albeit complex, datatype. This composable building block combined with several "get next token" loops will be used to generate human-like behaviour and understanding of the world at all levels of detail from catching a ball to high-level procedural reasoning, ethical decisions and a full episodic history thereof. All actions and thoughts will be steered by emotional priorities that consider the wider picture. Furthermore this building block will be human readable (with suitable tools) and it will facilitate the setting of ethical and other values by incorporating libraries of exemplar scenarios that can be created and discussed in non-technical human terms.
