## Stories and Association - The Warp and Weft
A possibly useful metaphor for one aspect of thinking is via weaving. Tapestries are woven from the warp and the weft - perpendicular threads that interlock to bind the whole tapestry together.

The warp can be seen as narrative knowledge "this, then that, then that" - temporal sequences that we use to predict, plan and generally understand the world. 

The weft can be seen as knowledge of the properties of things and how they are similar or dissimilar.
